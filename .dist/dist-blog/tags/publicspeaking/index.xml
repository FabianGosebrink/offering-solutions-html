      <description>In this blog post I want to give a short overview about my upcoming speaking activities in the rest of 2019.
04.10.2019 .NET Conf 2019 With collaborated forces of different UserGroups around Zürich we are presenting a meetup to have the .NET Conf local in Zürich. I will give a short introduction about what is new in ASP.NET Core 3.0. Meetups are usually a nice place to get started.
