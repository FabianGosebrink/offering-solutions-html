      <description>In this blog post I want to write about how you can move from TravisCI to GitHub Actions. Together with DamienBod I am maintaining an Angular library for OIDC and OAuth2 angular-auth-oidc-client. In this blog post I want to describe why and how I migrated from TravisCI to GitHub Actions.

      <description>In this blog post I want to write about how you can deploy your Static Site - maybe blog - generated with Hugo to Azure with Github Actions.
We will deploy two things in this article: we deploy a Hugo blog to an Azure Web App and deploy all static content like pictures, styles and Javascript to a CDN which is implemented using an Azure Storage Account. The main site is an Azure Web App because I use multiple domains to point to my blog.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I want to write about how you can deploy your ASP.NET Core Web App running on .NET 5 to Azure with Github Actions.
GitHub Actions use a yaml format as well as the new Azure pipelines but their format is a little bit different. However I want to move more and more into GitHub Actions because I enjoy having my code an my build together and most of my repositories are stored in GitHub since private repositories are free.</description>

      <description>I wanted to mention that you can find me on GitHub from now on. I am available on GitHub with my personal profile.
I want to publish all my repositories I do code like new trials, hands-on-anythings and examples which will kick you off to get started with what the repository is about.
In every talk I do I will always refer to this repo so that the audience can code what I did in the talk right away.</description>
