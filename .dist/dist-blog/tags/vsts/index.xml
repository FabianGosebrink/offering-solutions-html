      <description>In this blog post I want to describe how you can build up a build and release pipeline for your Angular and ASP.NET Core applications using Visual Studio Team Services.
Preparation First of all you need an user account with which you can login to &amp;lt;yourname&amp;gt;.visualstudio.com. Then we will need a github repository where your project is checked in. As an example I will take the repository located on https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/ASPNETCore-Angular-Ngrx. The repository has the client and the server code completely seperated which makes it easy for us to switch technologies or to keep things seperated like we will do it with our build and release pipelines in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).</description>
