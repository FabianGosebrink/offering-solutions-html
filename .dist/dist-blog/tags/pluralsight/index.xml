      <description>In this blog post I want to announce my very first Pluralsight course &amp;ldquo;Structuring Angular Applications with Angular Libraries&amp;rdquo;
TL;DR I created my first Pluralsight course which is available here : Structuring Angular Applications with Angular Libraries with a corresponding GitHub Repository here https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/angular-libraries
Links   https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/structuring-angular-applications-angular-libraries
  https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/angular-libraries
  Preparation It was quite empty here for a while because at the end of last year I got accepted as a Pluralsight author and I got the chance to start my very first course.</description>
