      <description>I am very proud and really happy to announce that my video course &amp;ldquo;RESTful Web services with ASP.NET Core&amp;rdquo; was published on Packt. You can find it here:
https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/restful-web-services-aspnet-core-video
With ASP.NET Core you can build cross platform web apis which I am describing in this course. We dedicated this course to beginners who want to get started but are trying to cover many topics too. All of this is done with Visual Studio 2017.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I want to describe how I started recording my first Video training and tell you about the experiences I made during the recording.

Why? I had this &amp;ldquo;recording a video&amp;rdquo;-thing in my mind for a long time. But never had the equipment and the software to do it. So it was more a &amp;ldquo;Yes, I can get this video recording thing going sometime&amp;rdquo;. But a few weeks ago I went along and bought a microphone giving me a bit better quality than the microphone on an USB-Logitech-Webcam.</description>
