      <description>It has been quiet here for a while&amp;hellip; :-)
You may have noticed that I organised my first conference .NET Dayabout two months ago. Well, that is not true. The organisation itself took place long before that but the event took place approximately two months ago. With this distance of time I want to gather up what I learned from organising this event, what I take with me and what will influence the next conference if I will do this again some time :-)</description>

      <description>I am very happy to announce the .NET Day 2017 in Switzerland! In this blog post I want to give you a small background information on this, how this idea came up and about the current status.
The beginning The idea of this conference day came into my mind in the middle of 2016. I love conferences. I think that a developer has to stay updated on his well known topics as well as be open to new topics and has to keep on learning over and over again.</description>
