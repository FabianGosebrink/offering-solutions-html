      <description>In this blog post I want to write down how you can set the new windows Terminal as the default external console when working with VSCode.
I like to have the console in an external window and NOT inside my vscode instance so I often use the combination Ctrl + Shift + C to start an external console window at the folder I am currently with my vscode instance.
What bothered me was: I love the new Windows Terminal but I wanted it to start as default when I use my preferred combination on my keyboard.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I want to show you how to debug an Angular application with Chrome and VS Code.
First of all you need to install the extension in VS Code.
You can find it here
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug
or search in the extensions tab for the plugin directly:
After installing you probably have to enable the plugin and restart VS Code but in the end you will see your folder structure like normal.</description>

      <description>This time I want to show you how getting started with Visual Studio Code, AngularJS and Typescript.
Before we start: A new Typescript version was announced!! You can see whats new here and further information here.
I always wanted to get to know Typescript and see the advantages of it compared to the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; javascript and so I took my plain old sample application and tried to build it up with Typescript.</description>
