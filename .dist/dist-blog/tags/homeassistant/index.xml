      <description>In this blog post I want to write about how I started with home automation. Really starting from zero as I had no clue from home automation and only heard about it from colleagues and friends. The only thing I knew already was a Raspberry Pi because I was using it already as a Pi-Hole in my home. Other than that I had no clue about home automation. In the end I am sure that there is loads more to do and a lot of things to improve but lets go with my journey to it, what I have built up so far and how I got there.</description>
