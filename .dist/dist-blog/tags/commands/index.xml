      <description>In this blogost I want to show you the IMHO correct implementation of Commands in WPF. Feel free to discuss :)
Again we will take the code from the posts before (Wpf Basics I and Wpf Basics II) and make it nicer. Well: What we did was databind a string to the UI. Then we implemented a solution for notify the UI that something changed. Everything triggered with a small timer which was doing the work for &amp;ldquo;I have something new&amp;rdquo;.</description>
