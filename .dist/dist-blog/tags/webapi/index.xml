      <description>In this blog post I want to show you how to create an ASP.NET Core WebAPI. We will use a custom mapper (you could use AutoMapper for this instead, a repository which is a singleton in this blog here and we will use the normal CRUD operations to Create, Read, Update and Delete in the &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; here.
Code here https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/ASPNETCore-WebAPI-Sample
Visual Studio We will start with the ASP.NET Startup-File
ASP.NET Core Startup public class Startup { public Startup(IHostingEnvironment env) { var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .</description>

      <description>In this blog post I want to get you an idea of how to build a great RESTful Service. The idea for this blog post came after I spent a whole post about implementing paging in a web API. Paging is a very important feature a REST API should offer. However, there are a lot more. Here I want to mention a few of them hoping to cover as much as you need to build great API’s ;-)</description>
