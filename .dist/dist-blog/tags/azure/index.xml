      <description>In this blog post I want to show how to upload files from an Angular application over an ASP.NET Core WebAPI to an Azure Blob Storage and save them there. Using an Azure Blob Storage for this is a perfect candidate not to pollute your App Service and store files there but use a dedicated system for this.

The Situation in the past As my company homepage and my blog have been two projects in the past I had two different repositories for both which were lying on an azure devops git repo (html page) and on github.</description>

      <description>It has been quiet here for a while&amp;hellip; :-)
You may have noticed that I organised my first conference .NET Dayabout two months ago. Well, that is not true. The organisation itself took place long before that but the event took place approximately two months ago. With this distance of time I want to gather up what I learned from organising this event, what I take with me and what will influence the next conference if I will do this again some time :-)</description>

      <description>I am very happy to announce the .NET Day 2017 in Switzerland! In this blog post I want to give you a small background information on this, how this idea came up and about the current status.
The beginning The idea of this conference day came into my mind in the middle of 2016. I love conferences. I think that a developer has to stay updated on his well known topics as well as be open to new topics and has to keep on learning over and over again.</description>

      <description>Hi,
in this post I want to show you how to use ASP.NET-WebHooks with an example of DropBox and Github. This app will be hostet on Windows-Azure and we&amp;rsquo;ll be using Visual Studio 2015.
The code in this example will be available on GitHub.
You can find a great summary here and here of what WebHooks exactly are. In short: You can receive updates from Websites and catch them with your own staying always up to date and seeing what is happening to your subscribed websites like Instagram, DropBox, GitHub etc.</description>
