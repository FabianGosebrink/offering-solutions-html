      <description>In this post I want to show you how to implement a table filter in Angular.
 NOTE: Keep in mind that this only filters the client side values meaning the values you already loaded to the client! Filtering should maybe be a server side thing when you only call the data you really want, sending a request to your API with the term you want to filter your resources on right on the DB.</description>
