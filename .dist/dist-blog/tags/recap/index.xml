      <description>With this blog post I want to recap my year 2018 and find a personal resume - partly for me as I have to know where I am standing and what this year brought for me but also for the readers of this blog of course. I also want to see what I can improve for the next year and, well, maybe I can really improve some things. I will try, for sure!</description>
