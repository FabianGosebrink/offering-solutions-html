      <description>In this blog post I want to explain how you can secure an electron app written in Angular with OIDC and OAuth2 using IdentityServer4 as the Secure Token Server.
 This is kind of a follow up blog post of my previous one Securing a Cordova App Implemented with Angular Using OIDC and OAuth2
 TOC  Understanding the problem What we will use Configuring the authentication library Adding the authentication in the Angular App Catching the redirect in the electron main process Catching the event in the Angular app  Understanding the problem We are using the code flow to authenticate our application against the Secure Token Server (STS).</description>

      <description>In this blog post I want to explain how you can secure a Cordova app written in Angular with OIDC and OAuth2 using IdentityServer4 as the Secure Token Server. We will take a look at an Angular project created with the AngularCLI or the NxDevTools and then turn it into a Cordova app via the Cordova CLI to let it run on the mobile phone and set everything up that we can authenticate to get an identity token and an access token and navigate back to our app to consume a protected API.</description>

      <description>In the last blog postI lost a few words about the REST-API the FoodChooser is talking to. In this blog I want to talk about the clients I developed. This is: Angular, ASP.NET WebAPI, Azure &amp;amp; Cordova, Cross Platform – My Private Hackathon Part 2.
Well I started coding an AngularJs 1.x Client with Typecript which is available here
https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/ASPNET-Foodchooser-Cross-Platform-AngularJS
Of course I could not stop looking and digging into Angular.</description>

      <description>Motivation I had a few free hours and was curious and wanted to know what you can achieve in 9 hours of coding. Due to the fact that I am very into ASP.NET development with Angular I coded a small application which is based on ASP.NET Web API, AngularJs/Angular2 with Typescript &amp;amp; co. So the question is: How far will I go in 9 hours? This is my private Hackathon!!</description>
