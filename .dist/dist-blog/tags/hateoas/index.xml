      <description>This blog post shows how to implement CRUD operations in Angular which are driven by an ASP.NET Core Web API using HATEOAS.
A quick note The HATEOAS in this repository does not follow any &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; like e.g. HAL. But it is enough that you get the idea and an impression how to use it.
I played around a little bit with this in the last time and maybe you can get some inspiration of how to get stuff going with that in your project.</description>
