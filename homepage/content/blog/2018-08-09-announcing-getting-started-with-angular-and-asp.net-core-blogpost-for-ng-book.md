I wanted to announce another blog post I wrote for the famous "ng-book" called "Getting started with Angular and ASP.NET Core" and you can find it [here](http://blog.ng-book.com/getting-started-with-angular-and-asp-net-core/)

Some time ago [Nate Murray](https://twitter.com/eigenjoy) contacted me asking if I would be willing to write a blog post for ng book which he can publish over the [NgNewsletter](https://twitter.com/ngnewsletter). I immediatelly said "Yes" and began to write about my favorite topics "Angular" and "ASP.NET Core".

This tutorial describes the first steps of starting with distributed applications and how to get them going digging a little into every field. Of course there is much much more to explore. Maybe you find it helpful!

Enjoy!!
