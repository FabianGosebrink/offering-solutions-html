In this blog post I want to announce my very first Pluralsight course "Structuring Angular Applications with Angular Libraries"

## TL;DR

I created my first Pluralsight course which is available here : [Structuring Angular Applications with Angular Libraries](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/structuring-angular-applications-angular-libraries/table-of-contents) with a corresponding GitHub Repository here [https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/angular-libraries](https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/angular-libraries)

## Preparation

It was quite empty here for a while because at the end of last year I got accepted as a Pluralsight author and I got the chance to start my very first course.

After a time of finding the "right" field and a few calls we fixed my topic down to "Structuring Angular Applications with Angular Libraries". I was so excited! So I started preparing myself and bought audio equipment (better mic, audio foam, microphone arm, ... and a lot of other things) to get my room ready for starting the recording.

Defining the slides, getting a structure going for the course was very time consuming. Also cutting, recording etc. but in the end it was really worth it.

## Course structure

The course is structured in seven chapters:

1. Course Overview
2. Introduction
3. Understanding the Problem of Growing Applications
4. Building a Typescript Library
5. Creating and Using Your First Angular Library
6. Building, Packing, and Using the Library in Another Application
7. Deploying the Library to NPM

In the first two chapters we are going to examine what the course is about and what we need to get started. We will also take a look at the sample app which you can find under the [Github Repository](https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/angular-libraries).

The module "Understanding the Problem of Growing Applications" is about the architectural blocks of an Angular application and how we can behave when the applicaiton grows and grows. So we will take a look at which steps we can take to get over this problem and how libraries can help us getting our application into shape and architecture.

In the module "Building a Typescript Library" we are getting to know all the different module systems Javascript provieds to get a little historical view, to prepare ourselves for the outcome of angular libraries later and to get a feeling of abstraction and how that looks like in code. After getting to know the modules we will also use them in Typescript and in the end we will have implemented our first Typescript library from scratch!

All this knowledge can be used in the module "Creating and Using Your First Angular Library" where we will first create an Angular library with the `ng-packagr` and after that with the AngularCLI. We do learn about all the files and folders which are created and use a library for extracting a component and a service from our sample app into that library and use it from there.

In the chapter "Building, Packing, and Using the Library in Another Application" we will get to know all the surroundings of a library like testing it, linting it, and use the library locally with `npm link`, `npm install` and `npm pack` from another place to test it before we publish it to npm, which we do in the final chapter. We learn about scopes and how we can push the library to npm to share it with the world.

## Final thoughts

I really enjoyed the time when I created this course. It was a long term wish to become a Pluralsight author and now I have released my first course. This is amazing. However the time has been really tough and doing a video course requires effort if you want to hit the quality Pluralsight provides. But Pluralsight really helped me there and I think the amount of effort and time was really really worth it. I would love to do a Pluralsight course again, so I hope this was not my last one.

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the course.

Fabian
