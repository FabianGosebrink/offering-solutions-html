With this blog post I wanted to announce that I got re awarded for the Microsoft MVP award another year and most importantly I wanted to thank everybody on the journey over the last years.

> The Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award is given by Microsoft to "technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community." They are awarded to people who "actively share their ... technical expertise with the different technology communities related directly, or indirectly to Microsoft". The MVP recognition lasts for a year and is awarded for a person's Microsoft related activity, contributions and influence over the previous year.
