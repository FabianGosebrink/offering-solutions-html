=================

I am so happy to announce that I will speak on the TechDays 2016 in Baden for the first time! I never expected Microsoft to ask me about doing a presentation at this event but they did :) And so I got a slot in the afternoon of the 1st of March. I know this is the last slot of the day and also the end of the TechDays this year but I will do my very best to give you a great technical and entertaining fade-out of this event.

The talks is about Web development with Angular2 in combination with SignalR and we will have a demo working on ASP.NET Core 1.0. I will hold it in german.

> I know the title shows "ASP.NET 5" but the ASP.NET-Team did the renaming just after I gave Microsoft my title. I will mention that in my talk but just to know: We will of course work with ASP.NET Core 1.0

[DamienBod](http://damienbod.com/) (many thanks to him at this place) and we will take a look at some pitfalls I discovered and how to avoid them.

Hope to see you there! Looking forward to this!

Fabian
