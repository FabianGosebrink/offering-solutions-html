In this blog post I want to give a short overview about my upcoming speaking activities in the rest of 2019.

## 04.10.2019 .NET Conf 2019

With collaborated forces of different UserGroups around Zürich we are presenting a meetup to have the .NET Conf local in Zürich. I will give a short introduction about what is new in ASP.NET Core 3.0. Meetups are usually a nice place to get started.

## 07.10.2019 ngRome

NgRome is a community driven conference which is also a reason why I am looking forward to that one so badly. I think this is gonna be the highlight of the year for me. I am speaking in a lineup with other speakers I really look up to and never expected to mention my name with then in one go. However...I am nervous already but am already so excited. The topic will be "Architecting Angular Applications with Angular Libraries" and the talk will have a duration of 20 minutes. This is gonna be so incredible good...

Topic: Architecting Angular Applications with Angular Libraries

## 09.10.2019 Angular Days

At the this years Angular Days I will give a workshop about Testing with Angular. So we have 3.5 hours to get to know testing and all the tools which are included. If I teach people Angular testing is a ery hot topic which I try to get covered in the beginning or in early stages of the course. This workshop however will completely focus on testing with Karma, Jasmine, Protractor, Cypress and all different scenarios.
