This course is a journey through testing with Angular tools and best practices. With the Angular CLI's built in testing tools like `Karma` and `Jasmine` the varieties of components and service testing are explored. As a comparison `Jest` is also used to perform unit tests. To wrap up this course `Cypress` is used to perform end-to-end testing to ensure the current state-of-the-art.

Testing will be prepared for:

- (Async) Pipes
- Sync/Async and HTTP Services
- Routing
- Directives
- Components with Inline Templates
- Components with external Templates
- Components with `Input()`/`Output()` Decorators
- Nested Components
- End to End Testing
- ...
