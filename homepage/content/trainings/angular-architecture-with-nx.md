To build up scalable, maintainable and extendable architectures with an Angular application working with a nx workspace is the best option to use.

Nx supports you breaking your application into different parts, reducing the complexity and increasing the maintainability of your application over the whole.

In this workshop you will learn how to set up your Nx workspace right with the tools you need, using the frameworks which are built in and how to set up and get your Angular Application into shape.

If needed the state management with NgRx and Facades is introduced as well.


- Setting up an nx workspace
- Using the built in commands
- Understanding the difference between the AngularCLI and the NX CLI
- When to build libraries
- Where to place the logic in libraries
